Whether you have a Maruthi or a BMW, the road remains the same.
Whether you travel economy class or business, your destination doesn't change.
Whether you have a titan or a Rolex, the time is the same.
Whether you have apple iphone or lava, people who call you remains the same.
There is nothing wrong in dreaming a luxurious life.
What needs to be taken care of is to not let the NEED become GREED.
Because needs can always be met... but greed can never be fulfilled.
